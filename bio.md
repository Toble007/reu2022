double major in CS and Chemistry with a minor in Japanese. She is conducting research with the
physics department studying quantum computing and photon resolution using machine learning. In 
addition, she works with UVA's Repair Lab to study gentrification in Norfolk, VA.

She is currently participating in the Biocomplexity Institute's C4GC REU program. Her interests
include computer architecture, machine learning, and quantum computing alongside quantum mechanics.

## Jackson Miskill

Jackson Miskill has completed his second year at the University
of Virginia where he is studying Computer Science and Cognitive
Science. He will receive a Bachelor of Arts degree from UVa in
Spring of 2024. Jackson has studied python and java in his courses,
delving into concepts from basic syntax to data structures and algorithms. 

Jackson is currently working at the UVa Biocomplexity Institute 
under Dr. Gregor von Laszewski as a part of the Computing for

between python and cloud computing. In the future, Jackson plans
to continue research. 

## Jacques Fleischer

![Jacques's Picture](project/images/bio/jacques.jpg)

Jacques Fleischer is a sophomore at the Miami Dade Honors College. 
He is set to receive his associate degree in computer science in 
summer 2022. He received the Miami Dade Honors College Fellows 
Award and currently maintains a 4.0 GPA on the Dean’s List.

In the summer of 2021, he participated in the Florida-Georgia 
Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation REU Data
Science and AI Research Program; his research focused on 
predicting the price of cryptocurrency using artificial
intelligence. This was done in conjunction with faculty from 
Florida A&M University and Indiana University. He presented
his findings at the Miami Dade College School of Science 
Symposium in October 2021. Jacques was accepted to the 2022
Emerging Researchers National (ERN) Conference in STEM after 
applying with his abstract on cryptocurrency time-series.
Additionally, he was one of four Miami Dade College students 
to be nominated for the Barry Goldwater Scholarship due to
his research findings.

Jacques is active in extracurriculars; for instance, he is the 
current Vice President of the MDC Computer Club. There, he hosts 
virtual workshops on how to use computer software, including 
Adobe Premiere Pro and PyCharm. He is also a member of Phi Theta 
Kappa. Furthermore, he is an active contributor to Cloudmesh: an 
open-source, all-in-one grid-computing solution written in 
Python. He presently participates in the University of Virginia’s 
Computing for Global Challenges program with Dr. 
Gregor von Laszewski and Dr. Geoffrey C. Fox to find high 
performance computing solutions using Raspberry Pis.
