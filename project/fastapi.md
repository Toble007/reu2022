# FastAPI 

FastAPI is a Python framework that allows developers to use the RestAPI interface to call 
functions that implement applications. RestAPI is used to call the common building block of an application.
## FastAPI Install

There are two ways to install the FastAPI: either completely with the `uvicorn` or partially 
with both the `FastAPI` and the `uvicorn`.

```bash
$ pip install "fastapi[all]"
$ pip install "uvicorn[standard]"
```

## FastAPI Example

The simplest FastAPI file could look like this:

```
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```
Copy it in a file called `main.py`.

Start the live server as follows:

``` bash
$ uvicorn main:app --reload 

INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [28720]
INFO:     Started server process [28722]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.

```
There's a line that output something like:

```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
This line displays the URL where your app is served on your local machine.

Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser.

The JSON response will appear as:

```
{"message": "Hello World"}
```

* Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

*  OpenAPI :

  Using the `OpenAPI` standard for defining APIs, FastAPI creates a `schema` with all of your APIs.

  You can see it directly at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json.

It will display a JSON that starts with:

```json
{
    "openapi": "3.0.2",
    "info": {
        "title": "FastAPI",
        "version": "0.1.0"
    },
    "paths": {
        "/items/": {
            "get": {
                "responses": {
                    "200": {
                        "description": "Successful Response",
                        "content": {
                            "application/json": {


```

### Step 2: create a FastAPI instance

```
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

The variable `app` will be a "instance" of the class `FastAPI` in this case.

This will be the primary point of contact for all API creation.

This is the same app that `uvicorn` refers to in the command:

``` bash
$ uvicorn main:app --reload

INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

If you create your app like:

```
from fastapi import FastAPI

my_awesome_api = FastAPI()


@my_awesome_api.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```
And copy it in a file `main.py` then you would call `uvicorn` like:

``` bash
$ uvicorn main:my_awesome_api --reload

INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

### Step 3: create a path operation

Path here refers to the last part of the URL starting from the first .

So, in a URL like:
`https://example.com/items/foo`
...the path would be:


`/items/foo`

" While building an API, the "path" is the main way to separate "concerns" and "resources"."

Operation
"Operation" here refers to one of the HTTP "methods".

When building APIs, you normally use these specific HTTP methods to perform a specific action.
Normally you use:
* POST: to create data.
* GET: to read data.
* PUT: to update data.
* DELETE: to delete data.

In the HTTP protocol, you can communicate to each path using one (or more) of these "methods".

So, in OpenAPI, each of the HTTP methods is called an "operation".

#### Define a path operation decoratorÂ¶
```
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

### Step 4: define the path operation function

This is our "path operation function":

path: is /.
operation: is get.
function: is the function below the "decorator" (below @app.get("/")).
```
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```
This is a Python function.

It will be called by FastAPI whenever it receives a request to the URL "/" using a GET operation.

In this case, it is an async function.

You could also define it as a normal function instead of async def:
```
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

Reference: <https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/>
@app.get("/")
def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```


### Step 5: return the content
```
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```
You can return a dict, list, singular values as str, int, etc.

You can also return Pydantic models .

There are many other objects and models that will be automatically converted to JSON (including ORMs, etc). Try using your favorite ones, it's highly probable that they are already supported.
