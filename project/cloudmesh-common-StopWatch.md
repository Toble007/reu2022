# Cloudmesh StopWatch

Improve the documentation of Cloudmesh StopWatch if needed

<https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-common/blob/main/cloudmesh/common/StopWatch.py>

Please be reminded that we could develop a program that read the documentation form the docstring
Then we can safe it to a file, so we could autogenerate the md file from the docstring.
