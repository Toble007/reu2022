# Contribute

Before you do anything, check first if it is already in one of the
books.  Evaluate if it needs to be expanded in the book, or if a new
section is needed.  If a new section is needed, please consult with
Gregor and ask for approval. We will then also decide if the chapter
will be located in reu2022 or in books (both are repos).

Contribution will be determined based on review of commits, lines in
such a fashion that the final lines willbe considered. FOr example let
us assume you spent significant time on a section that ia a
duplication of what others do, we will then delete that sections and
you have not achieved a contribution.

So please make sure that you contribute valuable things.

Ask if you have an idea and want confirmation.
